## Code Highlighting and Technical Content

As a developer's blog, code presentation is crucial. Here are examples of the syntax highlighting capabilities:

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```javascript
// Modern JavaScript with advanced features
const fetchUserData = async (userId) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    const userData = await response.json();
    
    return {
      ...userData,
      lastActive: new Date(userData.lastActive),
      isOnline: userData.status === 'active'
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch user data:', error);
    throw new Error('User data unavailable');
  }
};
```

### React Components
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const UserProfile = ({ userId }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    const loadUser = async () => {
      try {
        const userData = await fetchUserData(userId);
        setUser(userData);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error loading user:', error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    loadUser();
  }, [userId]);

  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (!user) return <ErrorMessage />;

  return (
    <div className="user-profile">
      <img src={user.avatar} alt={`${user.name}'s avatar`} />
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      <p>Status: {user.isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline'}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### CSS/SCSS
```css
/* Modern CSS with custom properties */
:root {
  --primary-color: #007acc;
  --secondary-color: #f8f9fa;
  --text-primary: #333333;
  --text-secondary: #666666;
  --border-radius: 8px;
  --box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.user-profile {
  background: var(--secondary-color);
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  box-shadow: var(--box-shadow);
  padding: 1.5rem;
  transition: transform 0.2s ease;
}

.user-profile:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .user-profile {
    padding: 1rem;
    margin: 0.5rem;
  }
